# ML_Agents_Examples
---

The initial purpose of this repository is to create a stable working project for ML-Agents 3. There were a lot of installation files, so I thought of making this process less hassle.
 
>Only tested and aimed for Windows 11.

The Unity version used : 2022.3.12f1

# Installation steps
1. [Clone repository](#clone-repo)
2. [Create Conda Environment](#create-conda-environment)



## Clone repository

There are two ways to do this. One by creating an empty project, the other one by cloning this project.

This markdown file is about less steps, so let us continue with cloning this project. 

The project already comes with the required package contents as a part of the project.


## Create Conda Environment


First install the software Anaconda Navigator.

### Anaconda Navigator Steps :

Go to the Environments tab:

![Alt text](./Images/AnacondaEnv.png)

Then select the import option:

![Alt text](./Images/AnacondaEnvTabs.png)


Now in the Import fodler window, go to this file : 
>ML_Agents_Examples\Help\CustomNeeds\CondaEnvFile.png

![Alt text](./Images/CondaEnvFile.png)

Let the installations of the libraries in this environment complete. 

>## Note : If you have followed this step, please ignore CMD installation step.


### CMD Installation steps:
---
Once we are done with the installation open Anaconda Prompt.
- For mini conda installation, just search for the Anaconda Prompt. The following steps should work for miniConda.


Navigate to the cloned repository folder : 
```
...\ML_Agents_Examples\Help\CustomNeeds
```

Use the following command to install the required version of Python and libraries :

```cmd
conda env create --name my_env -f MLAgentsCondaEnv_r21.yaml
```

It might ask for a Y/N during one of the library installations. Enter Y, when it does.

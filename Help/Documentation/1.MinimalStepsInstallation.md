# ML_Agents_Examples
---

The initial purpose of this repository is to create a stable working project for ML-Agents 3. There were a lot of installation files, so I thought of making this process less hassle.
 
>Only tested and aimed for Windows 11.

The Unity version used : 2022.3.12f1

# Installation steps
1. [Clone repository](#clone-repository)
2. [Create Conda Environment](#create-conda-environment)
3. [Local package installation](#local-package-installation)
4. [Running your first ML project](#running-your-first-ml-project)



## Clone repository

There are two ways to do this. One by creating an empty project, the other one by cloning this project.

This markdown file is about less steps, so let us continue with cloning this project. 

The project already comes with the required package contents as a part of the project.


## Create Conda Environment


First install the software Anaconda Navigator.

### Anaconda Navigator Steps :

Go to the Environments tab:

![Alt text](./Images/AnacondaEnv.png)

Then select the import option:

![Alt text](./Images/AnacondaEnvTabs.png)


Now in the Import fodler window, go to this file : 
>ML_Agents_Examples\Help\CustomNeeds\CondaEnvFile.png

![Alt text](./Images/CondaEnvFile.png)

Let the installations of the libraries in this environment complete. 

>## Note : If you have followed this step, please ignore CMD installation step.


### CMD Installation steps:
---
Once we are done with the installation open Anaconda Prompt.
- For mini conda installation, just search for the Anaconda Prompt. The following steps should work for miniConda.


Navigate to the cloned repository folder : 
```
...\ML_Agents_Examples\Help\CustomNeeds
```

Use the following command to install the required version of Python and libraries :

```cmd
conda env create --name my_env -f MLAgentsCondaEnv_r21.yaml
```

It might ask for a Y/N during one of the library installations. Enter Y, when it does.


## Local package installation

We now need to install local packages. Before that we need to install setup tools. Run the following command.


```cmd
pip install setuptools==49.1.2
```

Once done, we can now install the local packages. To do so, navigate to the MLPython folder where the following two packages are placed:


>ML_Agents_Examples\MLPython>python -m pip install ./ml-agents-envs

>ML_Agents_Examples\MLPython>python -m pip install ./ml-agents

Here are the commands that are needed to be copied and pasted in your CMD:

```cmd
python -m pip install ./ml-agents-envs
```

```cmd
python -m pip install ./ml-agents
```

## Running your first ML project

Always make sure that you always start the CMD via Anacondas right environment. You can find it here[hit the green colored button and select terminal]:

![Alt text](./Images/CMD_Env.png)

You can confirm the correct environment like this[it will be visible as the first name]:

![Alt text](./Images/CMD_Env_Name.png)

Open the Unity project[Add the project to the Unity HUB if haven't already.]

> NOTE : The Unity version being used in this case is : 

Navigate to this Basic scene and open it :

![Alt text](./Images/BasicScene.png)

Now in the CMD, enter the following command:

```cmd
mlagents-learn
```
Wait for it to complete and start listening to a port.

Once done, hit play in Unity. The Learning should initiate.
